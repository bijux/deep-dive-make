# Deep Dive Make: The Course-Book

A five-module course-book for learning **GNU Make as a declarative build-graph engine**—with an explicit correctness contract. The focus is not “Makefile tricks,” but **semantic discipline**: truthful dependency graphs, atomic outputs, parallel safety, deterministic results, and repeatable verification.

**At a glance**: progressive modules • minimal, reproducible examples • exercises with verification hooks • a runnable capstone that proves the claims.

**Quality bar**: every core assertion is designed to be *testable* using `--trace`, `-p`, and serial/parallel equivalence checks. This book assumes **GNU Make 4.3+** and intentionally avoids “hand-wavy” build folklore.

## Why this book exists

Many Make-based systems “work” by accident: undeclared inputs, ordering-by-phony targets, stamp files used as wishful thinking, and recipes that become unsafe the moment `-j` is enabled. These failures are costly because they are **intermittent**, **non-local**, and **hard to reproduce**.

This book treats Make as it is: an engine for evaluating a dependency graph. It teaches a strict contract:

- **Truthful DAG**: all real edges are declared (depfiles, manifests, or principled stamps).
- **Atomic publication**: outputs appear only when their construction succeeds.
- **Parallel safety**: `-j` changes throughput, not meaning.
- **Determinism**: serial and parallel builds converge to the same results.
- **Self-testing**: invariants are continuously verified, not assumed.

If you maintain a legacy Makefile or design a new build, the objective is the same: **correctness that survives scale and change**.

## How the book is written

Each module follows a consistent, engineering-first structure:

> **Concept** → **Semantics** → **Failure signatures** → **Minimal repro** → **Repair pattern** → **Verification method**

You are expected to distrust claims that cannot be checked. Where possible, the book provides direct verification via:
- `make --trace` (why something rebuilt)
- `make -p` (expanded database: targets/vars/rules)
- serial vs parallel equivalence checks (hashes, manifests, outputs)

## What you will learn

### Module map

| Module | Title | What it gives you |
|---:|---|---|
| 01 | Foundations | Make semantics, correct rebuild triggers, depfiles, atomicity primitives. |
| 02 | Scaling | Parallelism without races, discovery patterns, repository structure for growth. |
| 03 | Production Practice | Determinism, CI discipline, selftests, constraints that prevent drift. |
| 04 | Semantics Under Pressure | Edge cases that matter in real incidents: precedence, includes, multi-output modeling, rule subtleties. |
| 05 | Hardening | Portability, jobserver correctness, “hermetic-ish” techniques, performance, failure isolation. |

## Prerequisites

You do not need prior Make mastery. You do need the ability to work comfortably in a shell.

Required:
- **GNU Make 4.3+**
- **POSIX shell** (`/bin/sh`)
- **C toolchain** (for the capstone exercises)

**macOS note**: `/usr/bin/make` is BSD Make. Install GNU Make and use `gmake`:

```sh
brew install make
````

## How to read it

Recommended path (best learning outcomes):

1. Start at the syllabus: [`module-00.md`](module-00)
2. Read modules in order (01 → 05)
3. After each module, apply at least one pattern in the capstone and re-run selftests

If you are here for incident response or reference:

* jump to Module 04 and Module 05
* use the diagnostics playbook below

## Verification via the capstone

The course is paired with an executable reference build: [`make-capstone/`](https://github.com/bijux/deep-dive-make/tree/main/make-capstone). It exists for one reason: **proof**.

Run:

```sh
# Linux (GNU Make)
make -C ../make-capstone selftest

# macOS (GNU Make)
gmake -C ../make-capstone selftest
```

A passing run means the core invariants hold on your machine: convergence, serial/parallel equivalence, and negative tests that detect common lies (missing edges, unsafe stamps, non-atomic writes).

## Diagnostics playbook

When builds misbehave, start here:

* **Unexpected rebuilds**: `make --trace <target>` (find the triggering edge)
* **“It works on my machine” variables**: `make -p` and inspect `origin` / `flavor`
* **Parallel-only failures**: suspect missing edges or non-atomic producers; compare serial/parallel outputs
* **Generated headers / multi-output rules**: model producers explicitly; don’t rely on incidental order
* **Portability / recursion / jobserver**: treat as correctness topics, not convenience features

This book is designed to be both a curriculum and an operational reference.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome when they improve **correctness**, **clarity**, or **reproducibility** (tight repros, sharper diagnostics, better exercises).

Process:

1. Fork and clone
2. Make a focused change
3. Verify:

   ```sh
   gmake -C ../make-capstone selftest
   ```
4. Open a PR against `main`, with a short “claim → proof” note
